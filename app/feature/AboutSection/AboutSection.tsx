          <p>
            From sound waves to code ‚Äî I'm a sound engineer turned software
            developer who loves creating experiences that resonate. üîä <br />{" "}
            After a decade of crafting unforgettable moments for audiences
            around the world, I jumped into software to build things with
            staying power. <br />
            My background gives me a unique mix of creativity and technical
            know-how that I've been putting to work as a front-end dev for the
            past 5 years. <br />
            I'm all about creating digital products that actually help people.
            <br />
            Whether it's making data more accessible or building interfaces that
            just make sense, I bring energy and enthusiasm to every project and
            love collaborating with others to make cool shit happen. <br />
