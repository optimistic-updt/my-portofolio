            After a decade of crafting unforgettable moments for audiences
            around the world, I jumped into software to build things with
            staying power. <br />

            My background gives me a unique mix of creativity and technical
            know-how that I&apos;ve been putting to work as a front-end dev for
            the past 5 years. <br />
            I&apos;m all about creating digital products that actually help
            people.
            <br />
            Whether it&apos;s making data more accessible or building interfaces
            that just make sense, I bring energy and enthusiasm to every project
            and love collaborating with others to make cool shit happen. <br />
